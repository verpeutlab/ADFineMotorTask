# fine-motor-task
This is a repository that contains files used in the design, construction, and implementation of a pellet dispenser, in an Alzheimer's Disease motor task project. 
This was created as a part of project for the SOCIAL Neurobiology Lab, at Arizona State University, under the direction of Dr. Jessica Verpeut.

A guide to this repository:

"BRD File - Fine Motor Task Dispenser Design 2-Apr-23.brd" contains the schematic capture and PCB (printed circuit board) design. This was created and generated using Autodesk's Tinkercad. https://www.tinkercad.com/

"CODE - Motor Task Code 29-Mar-23.cpp" contrains the C++ code that runs on the Arduino board. You will need to use an ArduinoUNO board (or other compatible product) and then upload and run the code via Arduino IDE. The notation of this code provides information on how to modify the code to your particular needs. https://arduino.org/

"Fine Motor Task Dispenser Design 2-Apr-23.pdf" is a schematic representation of the electronic circuitry used in this project. This was created and generated using Autodesk's Tinkercad. https://www.tinkercad.com/

"Fine Motor Task Dispenser Design 2-Apr-23.png" is a PNG image of the electronic circuitry used in this project. This was created and generated using Autodesk's Tinkercad. https://www.tinkercad.com/
